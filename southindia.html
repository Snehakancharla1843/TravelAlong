    <p>Coorg, popularly known as the “Scotland of the South,” is an entrancing hilltop station not far from Bangalore. You will be able to witness various views of grey clouds that mix in gradually with the foliage of the hills, and the sight is worth witnessing. Coorg is an excellent location to go waterfall rappelling! While Coorg is a year-round tourist attraction, the optimum time to visit is during the monsoon, when the town is showered in the first drops of rain and the lush-green forests provide amazing views.</p>

    <p>Alleppey is one of the finest places to visit in Kerala during the rainy season. After Munnar, this is touted to be one of the best places to visit in South India during the monsoon due to the perceived sacred backwaters. While cruising through the azure backwaters, take in the scenery and enjoy a relaxing stay on a houseboat while soaking in the heavy rain, which, needless to say, is very well worth it. Whenever you visit Kerala, be sure to explore Alleppey and Munnar, both of which are definitely and truly spectacular. This city is lauded as South India’s Venice.</p>
